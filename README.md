Project Overview
Purpose
This application was created to help users decide what to eat based on different times of the day. It provides personalized meal suggestions for:

Morning (breakfast)
Mid-morning (light snacks)
Afternoon (lunch)
Mid-afternoon (quick bites)
Dinner (main course)
After dinner (desserts)

The app features a simple, intuitive interface that allows users to input the time of day and receive immediate meal suggestions, eliminating decision fatigue during busy days.
Design Considerations

1 User Interface

Clean, intuitive design with a minimal learning curve
Visually appealing color scheme that enhances readability
Card-based suggestion display for better visual separation
Responsive layout that works across different screen sizes


2 User Experience

Simple input mechanism (text input for time of day)
Clear error messages for invalid inputs
One-click reset functionality
Immediate feedback on meal suggestions


3 Code Structure

Modular code organization for maintainability
Comprehensive logging for debugging purposes
Efficient conditional logic for meal suggestions
Well-commented code for better understanding

GitHub and GitHub Actions Implementation
GitHub Repository Structure
The project follows a standard Android project structure with additional configuration for GitHub Actions:
/app
  /src
    /main
      /java
      /res
      /...
/.github
  /workflows
    android.yml
/gradle
...

GitHub Actions Configuration
The repository uses GitHub Actions for Continuous Integration (CI) with the following workflow:

Trigger Events

On push to main branch
On pull request to main branch


Workflow Steps

Check out code
Set up JDK 17
Grant execute permissions to gradlew
Run tests
Build the application
Upload the debug APK as an artifact



This CI pipeline ensures that:

The code builds correctly
All tests pass
A debug APK is generated and available for download

Benefits of CI/CD Implementation

Immediate Feedback: Developers get immediate feedback on their code changes
Build Consistency: Ensures that the application builds consistently across different environments
Test Validation: Validates that all tests pass before merging code
Artifact Generation: Automatically generates a debug APK for testing
Quality Assurance: Helps maintain code quality and prevents integration issues

How to Use the App

Enter the time of day in the text field (Morning, Mid-morning, Afternoon, Mid-afternoon, Dinner, After dinner)
Press the "Suggest Meal" button
Read the meal suggestion displayed on the card
Use the "Reset" button to clear the input and suggestion to start over

Future Enhancements

Add more meal options for each time of day
Implement food preference settings
Add dietary restriction filters
Include images of suggested meals
Implement a time picker instead of text input
